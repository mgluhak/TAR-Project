@AVAETC I always thought that was why you were working 20hr days to show the WHOLE film. Congratulations 👏👏👏
@3LWTV @LifeYouWantTour always , always the people and what they take away.
@RichOnOWN @AVAETC I think AVa would say not enough time. Right Avs?

Agree @Alanis anyone in public eye is in public service whether they're conscious of it or not.

@PhoebeFeed @OWNTV before I started OWN was having these conversations. They're the reason for #SuperSoulSunday
@SimonSaysLife @OWNAmbassadors but good to know right. It shows up All the time..got to keep it in check. #Ego #ANewEarth
@OWNingLight @EckhartTolle Correct . And more, ego is identification with any form. Consciousness is formless. #ANewEarth
Find out how practice and patience changed @dionne247.  Read her update here http://t.co/UxPlkgRhPb
You can watch Livestream Where ever you are. Right now . @EckhartTolle #ANewEarth
@JettikaSiregar @kerrywashington the universe will not support you in a desire to be someone else. Only You.
@alfier288 are you watching #ANewEarth from Ireland?
@GrowingOWN @EckhartTolle yep that's big aha
"""arrogance is a sign of fear of inferiority"".. So true, thanks for the clarity @EckhartTolle  #ANewEarth"
@bevysmith @Pharrell @OWNTV I agree one of most inspiring interviews I've ever done. luv Luv the way he thinks!
"""His need to win drains him of power"" that was an aha for me. Thanks @EckhartTolle  #ANewEarth"
@DevlinHuxtable those were my backyard trees. Watching them made my heart swell. And butterflies in my garden.
@DevlinHuxtable @UncleRUSH yep! Interviewing him this week.
@Official_AlexB_ @SuperSoulSunday @JaneGoodallInst good call..already booked her!
"""We become what we pay attention to"" I know this for sure.
@suemonkkidd and what you give your attention to expands.

"""You are Enough"".. Greatest lesson I've learned. #SuperSoulSunday"
"""Our true identity is in God "".. @EckhartTolle will be talking about our Roles vs. TrUE Self on A NEW EARTH immediately following this ."
@3LWTV @suemonkkidd wow I think nothing could be worse than to whimp out on ourselves .  #SuperSoulSunday
"@3LWTV ""no"" means A no ther way! #SuperSoulSunday"
"@kenlikebarbie I found that so interesting ""failure of courage"".. Another way of saying ""settling"". #SuperSoulSunday"

.@nada0971 did you hear that? Whatever brings us alive.. We should follow? #SuperSoulSunday
@PaoloPresta  you and me both.. What if we had stayed and worked in our fathers stores??  #SuperSoulSunday
@nada0971 I agree but to NOT follow your dream is to live a thousand deaths. #SuperSoulSunday
"If I had remained a reporter I would have been ""homesick "" Whereas  @GayleKing  is most at home, you can tell on @CBSThisMorning ."
"""Prayer is the attention of the heart"" loved that didn't you ? The soul often speaks thru longing. #SuperSoulSunday"
