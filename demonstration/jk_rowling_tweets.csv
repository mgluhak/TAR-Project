@docrtd @HashtagGriswold This gentleman has just arrived to prove my point. See how he's stopped sneering at women because I'm successful?
@HashtagGriswold The fact that an (unelected), privileged woman is crossing the Atlantic to grovel to Trump is not a blow for womankind.
@HashtagGriswold May was asserting that her mere presence is a feminist 'statement'. She isn't intending to 'speak for' anyone but herself.
@MockLabour @TheZephyrus1969 If Trump hadn't inherited $$$ from his daddy, he'd be the unemployed blowhard at the bar, groping waitresses.
@TheZephyrus1969 Trump may well be stupider than a box of spanners, but he‚Äôs noticed that women have achieved positions of power.
@TheZephyrus1969 My point is precisely that the mere presence of powerful/successful women hasn't cured Trump of misogyny so far.

You never know what the future holds. Astonishing reversals of fortune happen every minute. 8/12
Thinking back to my worst Christmas, I found it hard to believe that my unhappiness would pass. I was truly afraid of the future. 7/12
remember that extraordinary transformations are possible. Everything changes. Nothing is forever. 6/12
"But if your life is currently full of difficulties; if you aren‚Äôt where you want to be, either literally or figuratively, 5/12"
If you‚Äôre lucky enough to be with the people you love, warm and safe, with enough to eat, I‚Äôm sure you feel as blessed as I do. 4/12
At this time of year, we‚Äôre bombarded with images of perfect lives, which bear as little relation to reality as tinsel does to gold. 3/12

@TCHCollins @PoliticsScot What genuinely progressive movement ever included ethnic nationalists and people who call outsiders traitors?
@TCHCollins @PoliticsScot So no Scottish nationalist would care where anybody was born, or call an opponent a traitor?
@Sathnam Nonsense. There *is* a light that never goes out.

@PaulMCrone I'm perfectly ready to accept that you, personally, are all the things you claim the Yes movement is.
@PaulMCrone had a very different experience of the movement. The defence 'that guy isn't really part of us' doesn't inspire confidence. 3/3
@PaulMCrone has one. It claims to be inclusive, civic and even internationalist. That seems a very bold claim to those of us who have 2/3
@PaulMCrone But the trouble is, 'no' voters aren't claiming a homogenous identity, where as the 'yes' movement regularly asserts that it 1/3
@PaulMCrone Insisting that none of this happens, or that it isn't really part of the movement, alienates people you need to convince.
@PaulMCrone People who have been sent this kind of thing relentlessly since 2014 tend not to buy the 'few bad eggs' defence.
@PaulMCrone Yet many 'no' voters are unconvinced that Scottish nationalism contains no trace of the nastiness of other kinds. 2/2

@Mattia_Frasca OK, that made me cry a bit... X
Twitter's a strange place at times, but for every bit of hate I've received I've always had so much more love and support. Obrigada a todos!
I'd just like to say, because it would be downright rude not to, THANK YOU for the huge number of wonderful messages I've been sent tonight.
@rachelshamdiego I'm very sorry to hear about your household, but honoured to have been a help xx
@DamienBranche That is an incredible thing to hear. Thank you x
@Danbo12 There was no news, none at all, just leaping to mistaken conclusions and a ton of abuse.
@JenniferDelbol1 Everybody needs support sometimes. I'm very proud to have been yours, and yours means a lot to me today xxx

@_HunterDixon Yes, I caught onto that little life lesson late. Like, about 20 minutes ago.
@hoImesnwatson Thanks for the polite question, though!
@hoImesnwatson I would have thought it was kind of obvious if you look back over my timeline.
@hoImesnwatson No, the last three 'answers' in my bio refer to the person who has dominated my notifications for the past 5 days.

@ThisJayThomas in the face of calamitous and worsening personal approval ratings, he would not do the decent thing and step down 3/3
@ThisJayThomas is doing may be irreparable. Owen Smith may be the answer or he may not, but he does not appear to be so power mad that 2/3
@ThisJayThomas I have offered a reason. Corbyn has made it clear that he is determined to cling to power no matter what. The damage he 1/3
@ThisJayThomas Oh - and this https://t.co/8rCePv1O86
@ThisJayThomas I don't believe in political messiahs, but even if I did, Corbyn would not make my long list.
@ThisJayThomas These kinds of statements from international figures do not inspire confidence. https://t.co/GnLX1KFcx9
@ThisJayThomas His failure to put in place one concrete measure to combat threats of rape and violence to his own MPs is shocking.
@ThisJayThomas He's putting a huge amount of effort into his own reelection campaign. He went on holiday while his party was fighting Brexit
@ThisJayThomas Having voted against his own party more than any other MP, he now demands unwavering loyalty from Labour MPs.
"@ThisJayThomas This appals me &amp; many others. https://t.co/8rCePv1O86"
